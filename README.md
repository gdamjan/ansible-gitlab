Gitlab
======

Installs [gitlab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/) from git.
Generally follows the installation document on their site.


Requirements
------------

The role is created for Debian-like OS's. Depends on the uWSGI role, and also installs nginx as a frontend.


Role Variables
--------------

The role uses the following variables, that you can also override:

* `gitlab_hostname` - override to set the name of the virtual host, also used for email (defaults to `ansible_hostname`)
* `gitlab_branch` - gitlab branch to checkout
* `gitlab_shell_version` - gitlab shell version to checkout
* `gitlab_db_type` - database type to use (mysql by default)
* `gitlab_db_name` - database name (gitlab)
* `gitlab_db_user` - database user (gitlab)
* `gitlab_db_passwd` - database password (probably should change this, it's some random string now)
* `gitlab_user` - system user that's needed for ssh access
* `gitlab_ssh_port` - override if using different port for ssh (22 by default)
